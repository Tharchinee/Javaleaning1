2. object
3. polymorphism
4. Inheritance
5. Abstraction 
6. Encapsulation


Features:

1. Platform independent 
2. Case Sensitive -lower case and uppper case define separately

3 components

JDK - Java development kit
JRE - java Runtime Environment
JVM - Java Virtual Machine

1. core java concept - all object related 
2. Advance java concept - collection, data structure

To set up environemnt 
-----------------

1. JDK/java
2. IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJIDE etc)

Java versions 
------------------
Java 8 - Sun miccro systems
Java 9 - Oracle

JDK 11+ Preferable

Need to set JAva path
-----------------
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin
 C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21
 
 
 C:\Users\Siddharth\eclipse\java-2023-12
C:\Users\Siddharth\eclipse-workspace


create new java project - (file -> New -> java project 
create new java package - (right click on src -> package
create new class -( right click on package -> new -> class
---------------------------
Types of Comment: 
Single line //
Mulitple line /* end */
---------------------------------------------

Variables and Data types 

Variable is a container which can hold data to represent data we need variable
-------------------------

int number = 10
float decimal = 10.05
String collectio of char = "Tharchinee"
char grad = 'A'
boolean bool = True 

------------------------------------
Represent type of Data

** Premitive **
-------------------------
byte,short,long,int --- number without decimal
float, double ------ Decimal Number 
Char ------> Single char
Boolean ----> true/false

Non premitive **
----------------
String
Arraylist
HashMap
HashSet
etc
--------------------------------------
**short cut key:

front increase in eclipse = ctrl +
decrease = Ctrl -

System.out.println();  
- Syso - ctrl + space
